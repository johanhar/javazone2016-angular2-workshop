        description: `
            Java Testing with Spock teaches you how to use Spock
            for a wide range of testing use cases in Java. You'll
            start with a quick overview of Spock, and work through
            writing unit tests using the Groovy language. You'll explore
            the best practices for test design as you explore the Spock
            framework. As you move along, you'll learn to write mocks,
            implement integration tests, use Spock's built-in BDD testing
            tools, and do functional web testing using Geb. Readers new
            to Groovy will appreciate the succinct language tutorial
            that'll give you just enough Groovy to use Spock effectively.

        description: `
            An engine of the world economy, the computer industry is sputtering.
            What happened? Will it regain its power and again drive economic growth as in the past?
            That's the surprising conclusion reached by Erik Keller, a central player in the booming
            IT world of the 1990s. Driven by fear of being left behind, American corporations let
            IT grow until it reached one half of all corporate capital spending by the year 2000.
            Now, chastened by their spending failures, IT managers are converging on a new consensus:
            to exploit IT competitively they must use their smarts over big money.
            This shift in thinking comes just as free, open-source software, low-cost international
            programming labor, and new technologies combine to make the new approach possible.
            A former Research Fellow at Gartner, Keller had an insider's view of the irrational
            spending at many Fortune 500 companies, personally influencing billions of dollars of
            technology acquisitions
